# MyReads Project

Based on the starter template for the final assessment project for Udacity's React Fundamentals course. The goal of this project is to create an app that will control state and pass props correctly through react components.  Additionally, using react-router to move between components so that the browser's native navigation works as expected.

## TL;DR

To get started right away:

* clone the project with `git clone https://github.com/YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME`
* change directory into `cd reactnd-project-myreads`
* install all project dependencies with `npm install`
* start the server with `npm start` 

## Important
The backend API uses a fixed set of cached search results and is limited to a particular set of search terms, which can be found in [SEARCH_TERMS.md](SEARCH_TERMS.md). That list of terms are the _only_ terms that will work with the backend, so don't be surprised if your searches for Basket Weaving or Bubble Wrap don't come back with any results.
